# 1. Local Variable Type Inference.
no need to specify type of local varible 
for example: 
``` java 
var num = 10 ; // it infer type to integer  
var name = "ahmed" ; // it infer type to String 
```
but Java is still static-typed language so it's not allowed to change type 
``` java 
var num = 10 ; // it infer type to integer  
num = "ahmed"; // is in-correct. 
```

it will be useful for 
- Local intializer ` var name = "ahmed "`
- used with enhanced for-loop 
    ``` java
    for (var name : names){
    }
    ```
- basic for-loop 
    ``` java
    for (var i = 0  ; i < 10 ; i++){
    }
    ```

it has some **side effect** with **classes and interface**,it will effect code if use var varibles as names for classes and interface.

what not working? 
- varibale **must be intialized** so thes case are in-correct:  
    ``` java
    var a ;  // in-correct 

    for (var i  ; i < 10 ; i++){}  // in-correct 

    ```
- **not used with** ( method parameter, constructor parameter, method retrun type or any other variable declareation).

### Some histroy
it is not a new concept in Java 
- Java 5 added **Generics** and **Diamond**. 
- Java 8 added **lambda expression**.
