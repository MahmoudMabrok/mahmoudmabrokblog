to be good decision maker ask these 5 questions

# 1. Do I have  time? 
- ask for time, Do I have the time to think through this **systematically**, or is it time to make a gut call, use intuition?
- how **novel** is this situation? The **more novelty** you see in this situation, the more its unique from things you've done in the past, the more intuition can actually hit you in the gut and **be a problem**.
- Ask if you have serveral more hours it would help with 20 - 30 % for making better decision? if **yes** so invest more time, **otherwise** keep on your decision.


# 2. how important is the issue?
- use 20 -80 rule. 
- **80**% task do daily are **unimportand** , there are **20%** that **impact** your life, team, project.  
- if u facing a **80% percentor** that's not a place you want to over invest in time , 
just use **intuition**.

-  if you're dealing with a**20%**, something that's **far more important**, you gotta slow down. **Make the time** and be far more intentional in what you do. I want you to be **systematic** in that case.

# 3. Do you have the needed information?
- there are two issues here,  is data **accurate**, **right amount**?.

# 4. how should be involved?
